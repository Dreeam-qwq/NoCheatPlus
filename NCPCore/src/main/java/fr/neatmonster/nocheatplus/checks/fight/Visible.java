     * Perform a visibility check to determine whether the player can see the target entity.
     * This check is look-agnostic: it only uses world geometry and the attacker's eye position; it does not consider yaw/pitch in any way.<br>
     * The reason for this is to workaround issues with packet-inversion and de-synchronization.<p>
     * The check performs a direct straight ray trace from the target entity (or its block) to the
     * attacker's eye. If that ray is unobstructed, the hit is allowed.<br>
     * If the direct ray is obstructed, the code attempts to find an alternative path by walking
     * through neighbouring block coordinates. The search has been implemented in an opportunistic way: in each iteration, it picks a single neighbour that appears passable, updates the
     * ray to originate from that neighbour and proceeds from there, thus, the neighbour walk is NOT exhaustive. There is no backtracking or branch
     * enumeration. In fact, a visited set prevents re-checking the same block and {@link fr.neatmonster.nocheatplus.utilities.collision.tracing.ray.RayTracing.getMaxSteps()}
     * bounds the search further. Because of these constraints, the algorithm may fail to discover some
     * valid alternative paths (false positives), but the limit keeps the check performant.
     *

     * @param loc The location of the player's eye position.
